# Contributing to AnnFlux

We welcome your input! üëê

We want to make it as simple and straightforward as possible to contribute to this project, whether it is a:

- Bug Report
- Discussion
- Feature Request
- Creating a Pull Request (PR)
- Becoming a maintainer

## Bug Report

We use GitHub issues to track the bugs. Report a bug by using our Bug Report Template in [Issues](TODO).

## Discussion

We enabled [GitHub Discussions](TODO) in AnnFlux to welcome the community to ask questions and/or propose ideas/solutions. This will not only provide a medium to the community to discuss about AnnFlux but also help us de-clutter [Issues](TODO).

## Feature Request

We utilize GitHub issues to track the feature requests as well. If you are certain regarding the feature you are interested and have a solid proposal, you could then create the feature request by using our [Feature Request Template](TODO) in Issues. If it's still in an idea phase, you could then discuss that with the community in our [Discussion](TODO).

## Development & PRs

We actively welcome your pull requests:

### ¬†Getting Started

#### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the AnnFlux repository by following the GitHub documentation on [forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine and create a new branch from `main`.

#### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Set up your development environment to start contributing. This involves installing the required dependencies and setting up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Note that this guide assumes you are using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for package management. However, the steps are similar for other package managers.

<summary>Development Environment Setup Instructions</summary>

1. Create and activate a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n AnnFlux_dev python=3.11
   conda activate AnnFlux_dev
   ```

2. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Write Code:** Follow the project's coding standards and write your code with clear intent. Ensure your code is well-documented and includes examples where appropriate. For code quality we use ruff, whose configuration is in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file.

2. **Add Tests:** If your code includes new functionality, add corresponding tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) to maintain coverage and reliability.

3. **Update Documentation:** If you've changed APIs or added new features, update the documentation accordingly. Ensure your docstrings are clear and follow [Google's docstring guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

4. **Pass Tests and Quality Checks:** Ensure the test suite passes and that your code meets quality standards by running:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

5. **Update the Changelog:** For significant changes, add a summary to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

6. **Check Licensing:** Ensure you own the code or have rights to use it, adhering to appropriate licensing.

7. **Sign Your Commits:** Use signed commits to certify that you have the right to submit the code under the project's license:

   ```bash
   git commit -S -m "Your detailed commit message"
   ```

   For more on signing commits, see [GitHub's guide on signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

<summary>Suppressing False Positives</summary>

If necessary, to suppress _false_ positives, add inline comment with specific syntax.
Please also add a comment explaining _why_ you decided to disable a rule or provide a risk-acceptance reason.

#### Bandit

Findings can be ignored inline with `# nosec BXXX` comments.

```python
import subprocess # nosec B404 # this is actually fine
```
